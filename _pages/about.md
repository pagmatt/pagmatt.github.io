I'm a PhD student in the [SIGNET group](https://signet.dei.unipd.it/) at the [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.dei.unipd.it/home-page) of the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/).

I am interested in the modeling, analysis and design of cellular telecommunication networks. In particular, most of my research focuses on the performance evaluation of 5/6G communication networks, primarily using simulation tools.
