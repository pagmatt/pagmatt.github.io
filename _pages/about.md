I'm a PhD student in the [Psychology of Information Processing group](https://www.pip.tu-darmstadt.de/ag_pip/index.en.jsp) at the [Centre for Cognitive Science](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/cogsci/ccs/index.en.jsp), TU Darmstadt.

I am interested in probabilistic models of perception and action. While classical psychophysical experiments have largely focused on simple forced-choice decision-making using independent trials, there is a recent trend towards more naturalistic sequential tasks. To understand the uncertainties, intrinsic costs of behavior, and subjective internal models involved in these tasks, I use computational modeling techniques including inverse optimal control and Bayesian inference.
