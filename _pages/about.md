I'm a PhD student in the [SIGNET group](https://signet.dei.unipd.it/) at the [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.dei.unipd.it/home-page) of the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/).

I am interested in the modeling, analysis and design of cellular telecommunication networks. In particular, most of my research focuses on the performance evaluation of 5/6G communication networks, primarily using simulation tools such as [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/). 
As part of my research endeavours I have been developing and maintaining [ns3-mmwave](https://github.com/nyuwireless-unipd/ns3-mmwave), an ns-3 module for simulating 5G networks.

I like to spend my free time having aperitivos with my friends, weightlifting, playing the guitar and working on side projects :)
