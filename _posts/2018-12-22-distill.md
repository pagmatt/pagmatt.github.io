## Equations

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).

## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

***

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

***

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look good in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
  return x * x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

***

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

***

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

Two-Ray fading model
================================
The model aims to provide a performance-oriented alternative to the 3GPP TR 38.901
framework [TR38901]_ which is implemented in the ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel and
ThreeGppChannelModel classes and whose implementation is described in [Zugno2020]_.
The overall design follows the general approach of [1], with aim of providing
the means for computing a 3GPP TR 38.901-like end-to-end channel gain by combining
several statistical terms. The frequency range of applicability is the same as
that of [TR38901]_, i.e., 0.5 - 100 GHz.

Implementation - TwoRaySpectrumPropagationLossModel
########################################################
The computation of the channel gain is taken care of by the TwoRaySpectrumPropagationLossModel
class. In particular, the latter samples a statistical term which combines:

* The array and beamforming gain, computed as outlined in [Rebato2018]_ using the
  CalcBeamformingGain function. This term supports the presence of multiple
  antenna elements both at the transmitter and at the receiver and arbitrary antenna
  radiation patterns. Specifically, the array gain is compute as:

  .. math::
  G_{\mathrm{AA}}(\theta, \varphi)=\left|\boldsymbol{a}^{\mathrm{T}}(\theta, \varphi)
  \boldsymbol{w}\left(\theta_0, \varphi_0\right)\right|^2=\left|\mathrm{AF}_{\mathrm{v}}(\theta,
  \varphi)\right|^2\left|\mathrm{AF}_{\mathrm{h}}(\theta, \varphi)\right|^2 G(\theta, \varphi), \\
  ..
  where:

  .. math::
  \operatorname{AF}_{\mathrm{v}}(\theta, \varphi)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{v}}}}
  \sum_{m=0}^{N_{\mathrm{v}}-1} e^{j k d_{\mathrm{v}} m\left(\cos \theta-\cos \theta_0\right)} \\

  \operatorname{AF}_{\mathrm{h}}(\theta, \varphi)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{h}}}}
  \sum_{n=0}^{N_{\mathrm{h}}-1} e^{j k d_{\mathrm{h}} n\left(\sin \theta
  \sin \varphi-\sin \theta_0 \sin \varphi_0\right)},

  where, in turn, :math:N_h, :math:N_v are the number of horizontal and vertical antenna
  elements respectively, :math:d_h, :math:d_v are the element spacing in the
  horizontal and vertical direction respectively.

  Whenever the link is in NLOS, a penalty factor is introduced, to account for beam
  misalignment due to the lack of a dominant multipath component [Kulkarni]_;

* A fast fading term, sampled using the Fluctuating Two Ray (FTR) model distribution [Romero]_.
  The latter is a fading model which is more general than typical ones, taking into account two
  dominant specular components and a mixture of scattered paths. As, a consequence it has
  been shown to provide a better fit to fading phenomena at mmWaves. The model parameters
  are automatically picked once the simulation scenario is set, using a lookup table which
  associates the simulation parameters (such as carrier frequency and LOS condition) to the
  FTR parameters providing the best fit to the corresponding TR 38.901 channel statistics.
  As a consequence, this channel model can be used for all the frequencies which are
  supported by the 38.901 model, i.e., 0.5-100 GHz. The calibration has been done by
  first obtaining the statistics of the channel gain due to the small-scale fading in
  the 3GPP model, using an ad hoc simulation script
  (src/spectrum/examples/three-gpp-two-ray-channel-calibration.cc). Then, this information
  has been used as a reference to estimate the FTR parameters yielding the closest
  (in a goodness-of-fit sense) fading realizations, using a custom Python script
  (src/spectrum/utils/two-ray-to-three-gpp-ch-calibration.py).

**Note:**

  * To then obtain a full channel model characterization, the model is intended to be
    used in conjunction of the path loss and shadowing capability provided by the
    ThreeGppPropagationLossModel class.
    Indeed, the goal of this model is to provide channel realizations which are as close
    as possible to ones of [TR38901]_, but at a fraction of the complexity. Since the
    path loss and shadowing terms are not computationally demanding anyway, the ones of
    [Zugno2020]_ have been kept;

  * Currently, the value of NLOS beamforming factor penalty factor is taken from
    the preliminary work of [Kulkarni]_ and it is scenario-independent; As future
    work, the possibility of using scenario-dependent penalty factors will be
    investigated.

Testing
#######
The test suite TwoRaySplmTestSuite includes three test cases:

* FtrFadingModelAverageTest, which checks that the average of the Fluctuating Two Ray (FTR)
  fading model realizations is consistent with the theoretical value provided in [Romero]_.

* ArrayResponseTest, which checks that the overall array response at boresight computed by the ù
  CalcBeamformingGain function coincides with the expected theoretical values.

* OverallGainAverageTest, which checks that the average overall channel gain obtained using the
  DoCalcRxPowerSpectralDensity method of the TwoRaySpectrumPropagationLossModel class is close
  (it is, after all, a simplified and performance-oriented model) to the one obtained using
  the ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel and ThreeGppChannelModel classes.
